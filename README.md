# Assignment: One HTML and CSS

For this assignment, you will clone Dr. John Monberg's wra410 repository.

You will update your README.md file so that I can learn about the changes you made.

If I can't find your changes, I can't give you credit for them

Revise the following section in your README.md file with a short description of what you've accomplished.

## Required Changes to WRA 410

1. Make changes to the background color of a page and a div.
  I wanted to make the page more "friendly" I found that these soft colors did the trick for me. I ended up changing the color palette for the rest of the pages as well.

2. Use a new font.
  I changed the font to make it less rigid. I made the font sans-serif throughout the webpages.

3. Include two images.
  I included pictures of the College of Arts and Letters on the main page (index). I also included a small Michigan State logo in the left hand corner of the headers. I think this made the pages more personal.

4. Use a table to format the Grading Scale on the Assignments page.
  Used a simple table to better display the grading scale.

5. Reformat the Student Groups. Use a different color for links, add a title for each group, seperate each student. Use multiple columns for the divs.  
  I made the groups into lists and used the same color palette I have been using. 

6. Add navigation to the Schedule webpage.
  Added a navigation that is similar to the ones found on other pages.

7. Revise the rows and columns on the Schedule webpage so the information is clearer or prettier.
  I added a table format to the schedule so that the information is better separated horizontally. The columns are separated by alternating colors. I also made the Week number more noticeable because that is the most important piece of information in that column. I added the title "helpful links" to bring attention to that column.
